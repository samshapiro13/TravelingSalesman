Date of Submission: 4/16/2020

Instructions to Run:
The program can be accessed by opening the TravelingSalesman.zip file and navigating to the TravelingSalesman folder using the command line.
To run the program from the TravelingSalesman directory, use the command:
python3 tsp-3510.py <input-coordinates.txt> output.txt <time>
as outlined in the project assignment PDF.

Known Limitations:
The <input-coordinates.txt> file must not have any empty newlines following the last node. This will throw off the parser and cause an error.
